This is a simple HTML/CSS-based project to demonstrate my abilities in recreating pre-existing websites in HTML/CSS on my own.
The project contains two pages.
The first page is the Google Homepage, which recreated the search engine page.
The second page is the Google results page, which recreated the results page following a search.
It should be noted that almost all functionality seen in the real Google homepage and results page are NOT functional in this project.
The main purpose of the project was to recreate the appearance, not the function.
